# odin-recipes
The goal of this project was to create webpages showing a variety of recipes. I took the opportunity to share recipes from my culture to make the process more personal & enjoyable.

This project focused on basic HTML and command-line skills, including git. This involved:
-creating new files using the CLI and navigating between directories.
-opening files in VSC and the browser from the CLI.
-setting up the HTML boilerplate.
-using different headings.
-inserting images into webpages.
-creating different types of lists, including nested lists.
-using links to navigate to different pages.
-using git commands to commit changes as the project progressed.
