<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Green seasoning is a necessity in a Caribbean household. It's largely responsible for the deep flavours
    of our meat dishes and <em>cannot</em> be ommited when cooking these. For example a plate of rice,
<a href="dhal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dhal</a> and <a href="curry-chicken.html"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curry chicken</a> would be a foreign entity without that
   rich, herby flavour.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 bundle celery (about 4-5 stalks).</li>
    <li>2 heads garlic, cleaned.</li>
    <li>3 large onions.</li>
    <li>6 leaves big leaf thyme.</li>
    <li>5 sprigs spanish thyme.</li>
    <li>36 leaves bandania (culantro/shadon beni).</li>
    <li>12 pimentoes.</li>
    <li>4 bundles chive (about 12 stalks).</li>
    <li>Water.</li>
    <li>Salt to taste.</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white vinegar (optional).</li>
    <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper (optional).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Roughly chop the onions, garlic, celery, chives, bandania and big leaf thyme. Add to rest of ingredients.</li>
    <li>Add a small portion of ingredients to a blender together with vinegar and 1/2 cup of water.</li>
    <li>Blend until smooth, adding a handful of ingredients at a time. Add extra water as necessary. <strong>Ensure that the blender cover is tightly secured.</strong></li>
    <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Once desired consistency is achieved store in airtight containers and refrigerate. If vinegar is not used the mixture will keep for up to 2 weeks. Vinegar will prolong the shelf life to up to a month.
        Alternatively the mixture can be frozen in ice cube trays and defrosted as necessary.
