<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe is ubiquitous in Trinbagonian culture, a staple in households and for
   special occasions alike. Chicken is cooked in curry powder together with a medley
   of spices and aromatics resulting in a highly fragrant and flavourful dish. This dish
   is most commonly enjoyed with rice or some form of roti (various types of flatbread) but
   may also be enjoyed by itself as "cutters." It reflects the rich Indo-Caribbean contribution
    to our culture.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, cleaned and cut into small pieces.</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped.</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped.</li>
    <li>1 large pimento, chopped.</li>
    <li>10 bandania (chadon beni/culantro) leaves, chopped.</li>
    <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper (whole).</li>
    <li>4 tbsp curry powder.</li>
    <li>1 tsp whole geera (cumin).</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil (oil of choice can be substituted eg. sunflower, canola.)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Golden Ray (or equivalent cooking margarine).</li>
    <li>Water.</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Green seasoning (homemade or store bought).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Season chicken with green seasoning and marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Add oil to a hot pot and let heat.</li>
    <li>Make a thick paste using curry powder and water. Add to hot oil and let cook until curry thickens and darkens.</li>
    <li>Add onion, garlic,pimento, geera (cumin) and 3/4 bandania (culantro) leaves and stir thoroughly. Let these <em>just</em> begin to cook.</li>
    <li>Add chicken and stir thoroughly to coat chicken in curry mixture. Add scotch bonnet pepper.</li>
    <li>Let the chicken begin to cook, stirring occasionally. <em>Do not add water even if chicken seems dry. 
        The chicken will release its own water so we want to avoid adding too much.</em></li>
    <li>Once chicken has released its own water, add water to <em>just</em> cover all the chicken.</li>
    <li>Let simmer, seasoning to taste.</li>
    <li>Add remaining bandania (culantro) leaves and Golden Ray. Stir so the margarine melts and is incorporated.</li>
    <li>Cook until tender. Serve with white rice (with or without dhal) or roti.</li>
