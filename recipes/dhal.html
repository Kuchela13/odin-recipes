<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dhal is a Trinbagonian (and Guyanese) staple made from yellow split peas. A versatile dish, it is most commonly enjoyed
    atop a bed of white rice accompanied by some type of meat, fish or vegetable 
    (my personal favourite being <a href="curry-chicken.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> curry chicken.</a>) 
    It is also enjoyed straight from a cup or eaten with roti. It is a hearty dish that nourishes the body
    as well as the soul.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb dhal (yellow split peas).</li>
    <li>1 tsp tumeric.</li>
    <li>1 small onion.</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic.</li>
    <li>1 pimento.</li>
    <li>2 tsps whole geera (cumin)</li>
    <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper (optional).</li>
    <li>3 tbsps vegetable oil (oil of choice can be substituted as long as it has a high smoke-point.)</li>
    <li>2 tsps baking powder.</li>
    <li>Water.</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preparation:
    <ul> <li>Soak dhal overnight in water with baking powder. Rinse thoroughly before cooking.</li>
         <li>Chop onion, pimento and 2 cloves of garlic into small pieces. Set aside remaining clove of garlic.</li>    
    </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>Add softened dhal to a pot together with 3/4 of the onion, chopped garlic, pimento,
        scotch bonnet pepper and tumeric. Cover with water.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>In a metal ladle or small saucepan add oil together with remaining onion, garlic clove and geera (cumin). Cook until garlic turns black.</li>
    <li>Once the dhal is tender/breaking apart <em>very carefully</em> add the contents of the ladle/saucepan to the pot.
    <strong>Pro-tip: Slip the contents of the ladle/saucepan into the dhal and <em>immediately</em> cover as this step 
        can cause the contents of the pot to splash and bubble.</strong></li>
    <li>Season to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve over white rice by itself or with accompanying dish of choice.
